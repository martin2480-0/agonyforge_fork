# This is the highest version of RabbitMQ that is supported by AWS's "Amazon MQ"

# protocol should be able to work. I am targeting Agony Forge at being deployed
# in AWS, so I'm trying to keep things like this as close as possible to what you'd
# see there.

# This is the highest version supported by AWS's "Amazon MQ" version of ActiveMQ as

#
# I stopped using it and switched to RabbitMQ because this version is getting pretty
# old. Apache released an update to ActiveMQ called Artemis and Spring Boot's starter
# library for activemq stopped getting updated in favor of their artemis one. Since I
# can't use newer versions on AWS and I can't use the old Spring Boot library in the
# latest Spring Boot, it made sense to swap over to RabbitMQ which seems to be getting
# more current support over there.
